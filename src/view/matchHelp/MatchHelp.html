    <p>
        When you click the "Search" button, the program focuses on the search button and checks what option you've chosen,
        like "All," "Tournament," "League," etc. It then performs a search based on your selection. For instance, if you
        choose "Tournament," it looks for matches associated with the tournament's name. Results are displayed in a user-friendly
        format, possibly a table. The code also handles potential issues, such as no matches found or server problems, and
        shows error messages to guide you. You can also remove the previous selected filters with the right button
